More Java Actor Frameworks Compared
Over the past few weeks, I've been looking at various (Java and Scala based) Actor frameworks. In an attempt to understand the API of these frameworks, I've been porting the same toy example consisting of three pipelined Actors responding to a bunch of requests shoved down one end of the pipe. To get a feel for how they compare, performance-wise, to one another, I've also been computing wallclock times for various request batch sizes. Mike Rettig (author of the Jetlang project) pointed out that the Jetlang numbers I published in my last week's post appeared incorrect in comparison to the Scala numbers. Rajesh Karmani (one of the authors of the ActorFoundry project) also expressed surprise that Kilim numbers were higher compared to Scala.

Mike was kind enough to take a look at the Jetlang code, and he suggested that the excessive amounts of console IO that the actors were making were causing it to perform worse than Scala. Taking the println() calls out from both the Scala and the Jetlang examples improved the performance of both significantly, and the Jetlang example ended up with lower elapsed time numbers than the Scala examples. Apparently, the performance characteristics of the Scala println() was different enough from the Java System.out.println() to skew the results. This week, I remove the console output from all the examples (after verifying that they work correctly) and republish the numbers.

Tim Jansen (author of the Actor's Guild framework), was also kind enough to build me an Actor's Guild version of my example.

Rajesh also took a look at the code for the Kilim example at my request, and he pointed out several improvements that may make Kilim run faster. I have incorporated his suggestions into the rewritten code. He also pointed me to his ActorFoundry project, and, over the last couple of days, he has been of immense assistance (via email) in helping me to build an ActorFoundry version of my toy example.

This week, I provide the updated code for Kilim and Jetlang, and code to work with Actor's Guild and ActorFoundry, and provide the elapsed time comparison between these frameworks (as well as the Scala examples from last week). In many ways, this post is largely due to the efforts of these three fine programmers. Thank you, gentlemen!
